"""W.A.T.C.H. — Window on Agents, Tools, Changes and Hand-offs.

A local observer for Claude Code and Codex sessions. (Working title during development: Live Room. Internal
identifiers such as ~/.live-room, the X-Live-Room-Key header and the hook marker keep that name so existing keys,
hooks and saved page settings continue to work.)

What it does
  * Reads the session logs the tools already write (~/.claude/projects, ~/.codex/sessions,
    ~/.cursor/projects/*/agent-transcripts) and streams what it finds to the page.
  * Optionally answers Claude Code permission prompts from the page (Allow / Deny), through the
    PermissionRequest hook that scripts/install_hooks.py adds. That part is NOT read-only.
  * Can ask macOS or Windows to open a session in its desktop app.

Trust boundary
  The server binds to 127.0.0.1. Every data or action endpoint (/events, /check, /keep, /unlink,
  /presence, /open, /decide, /hook, /permission) needs the key stored in ~/.live-room/key (mode 0600).
  Unlock (/pair) makes the server open a private file in your default browser; that file carries a
  one-time code, which the page trades for the key once, over HTTP on this machine (/claim). Served
  without the key: /pair, /claim, the page itself, and its own icon files under /static/ (an exact
  allow-list of four names). Previews of files an agent wrote (/fs/...) use a separate per-run
  capability token, not the key, and are served in an opaque sandbox; they reach only files the
  server granted. A program that can read the key file, or drive your browser, has the same power
  you do here. That is an OS-level boundary this tool does not try to cross.

  The hooks do not authenticate the server. They send the key, and the permission hook accepts an
  Allow or Deny, from whatever process is listening on the port. While this server is not running,
  another local program able to bind that port could collect the key and answer prompts. Keeping
  other local programs off the port is likewise outside what this tool protects against.

Run:  python3 src/server.py      (Windows: py src/server.py) then open http://127.0.0.1:8793/ and press Unlock
Env:  PORT (8793), WINDOW_MIN (20: how recently a session must have been active to appear)
